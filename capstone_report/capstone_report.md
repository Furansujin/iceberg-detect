## I. Definition

### Project Overview
This project constitutes an entry in a Kaggle competition, the [Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge). 

From the description:

> Drifting icebergs present threats to navigation and activities in areas such as offshore of the East Coast of Canada.
> 
> Currently, many institutions and companies use aerial reconnaissance and shore-based support to monitor environmental conditions and assess risks from icebergs. However, in remote areas with particularly harsh weather, these methods are not feasible, and the only viable monitoring option is via satellite. 
> 
> Statoil, an international energy company operating worldwide, has worked closely with companies like C-CORE. C-CORE have been using satellite data for over 30 years and have built a computer vision based surveillance system. To keep operations safe and efficient, Statoil is interested in getting a fresh new perspective on how to use machine learning (ML) to more accurately detect and discriminate against threatening icebergs as early as possible.
> 
> In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to build an algorithm that automatically identifies if a remotely sensed target is a ship or iceberg. Improvements made will help drive the costs down for maintaining safe working conditions.

Much like the "blips" on ships' radar in the movies, objects in the ocean are returned to the Sentinel-1 satellite as a bright spot on an image from its Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The satellite transmits a radar pulse and then records the echo of that radar bouncing off solid objects, which reflect back the energy emitted by Sentinel-1 more strongly than its surroundings (since in technical language, solid objects have a higher _reflectance_). The radar energy collected by the satellite is referred to as _backscatter_ and its intensity makes up the radar images presented herein. Additionally, this particular satellite is equipped with "side looking radar", and thus views its areas of interest at an angle, rather from directly above. This angle, measured perpendicularly from the earth's surface to the area of interest, is called the _incidence angle_ of the satellite. It is noted in the competition background information that "generally, the ocean background will be darker at a higher incidence angle". Finally, Sentinel-1 can transmit and receive radar energy in different planes. The combination of transmission plane and receiving plane is called the _polarization_ of the radar band.   

After identification on the SAR image described above, analysis is required to correctly identify the remotely sensed object. In our case, we are given the task of discriminating between ocean-going vessels and floating icebergs, which pose a significant danger. A [recent article from the European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Satellites_guide_ships_in_icy_waters_through_the_cloud) exposes the apparent benefits from such technology: the ability to programmatically detect threats to shipping and "navigate through...notoriously icy waters". The approach presented in this paper will leverage deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn what which features of a radar image determine an iceberg. A similar approach applied to the same problem is outlined by [Bentes, Frost, Velotto, and Tings (2016)](http://elib.dlr.de/99079/2/2016_BENTES_Frost_Velotto_Tings_EUSAR_FP.pdf), going as far to also be written in Python, but using the ML library Theano. The solution presented here will differ by preprocessing methods, the extra feature of the incidence angle, the software backend supporting the neural network (TensorFlow via Keras instead of Theano), and the specific CNN architecture employed to perform the classification. 

#### Input Data

To help accomplish our task, Statoil and C-CORE have provided us with two `json` files, one of labeled training examples (`train.json`) and one of unlabeled examples to test our model on (`test.json`). Each entry in both essentially contains a 75x75 pixel image composed of the backscatter levels from two different polarizations, along with the incidence angle the radar was emitted/collected at, and a label, if applicable. 

Specifically, each entry has the following fields:

* __`id`__ 
    * unique ID of the image for submission verification
* __`band_1`, `band_2`__ 
    * a list of flattened SAR radar image data
    * each band is a 75x75 pixel image, so each list has 5625 elements
    * values are decibels (dB) of radar backscatter at the given incidence angle and polarization
    * polarization of `band_1` = HH, where the radar is both transmitted and received in the horizontal plane
    * polarization of `band_2` = HV, i.e. transmitted horizontally and received vertically. 
* __`inc_angle`__ 
    * incidence angle of radar image
    * some entries have missing data and are marked as `na`.
* __`is_iceberg`__
    * target variable / label
    * 1 if iceberg, 0 if ship

- _Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?_

### Problem Statement

The aim of the competition is to distinguish an iceberg from a ship in satellite radar data, specifically images from the Sentinel-1 satellite constellation's C-Band radar. Each image provided contains only an iceberg or an ocean-going ship. Thus, labeling each entry in the test set as 1 for iceberg and 0 for ship (or not-iceberg) is perfectly reasonable, as is producing a probability that the image contains an iceberg.

Thus, overall, we may view our task as a binary classification problem: does an image contain an iceberg or not? 

#### Solution Strategy

Employing computer vision to detect if an object in an image is a well-supported approach to this problem. This can be accomplished by building a CNN and training it on the data to recognize features of our label, in our case an iceberg. See [Hasanpour et al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06205.pdf), [Springenberg, Dosovitskiy, et al (2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf) and others for numerous applications of CNNs for object detection. Once trained, a probability that a radar image contains an iceberg can be outputted. 

In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?_
- _Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?_
- _Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?_

### Metrics
The official evaluation metric of this Kaggle competition is the logarithmic loss, or "log loss", of our predictions. Also referred to by  "binary cross-entropy" in ML, this is a suitable metric, as it gives a notion of distance from our outputted probabilities to the actual label.

Detailed explanations of log loss are [available online](http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2015/12/making-sense-logarithmic-loss/), but the formula for log loss is presented here:

$$-\frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N {y_i \log p_i + (1 - y_i) \log (1 - p_i)}$$

where $y_i$ is the label (1 = iceberg, 0 = no iceberg) for image $i$, $p_i$ is the probability outputted by our model that image $i$ contains an iceberg, and $N$ is the total number of images.

The individual log loss is summed and divided by $-N$ to give a comparable metric between predictions of different size and in order to make the log loss positive to preserve the notion of minimizing loss. 

For a single image, if our prediction matches the label, a confident prediction probability will contribute little to the total log loss. However, if our prediction does not match, a confident incorrect prediction will contributed heavily to the log loss. We shall endeavor to minimize the log loss; a perfect classifier (that outputs 1.0 for all iceberg images and 0.0 for all non-iceberg images) would have a log loss equal to zero. 

In practice, functions that calculate log loss do not directly compute predictions of exactly 1 or 0. You might notice that a perfectly wrong prediction, such as predicting a definite in image $j$ containing a ship ($y_j = 1$) with probability $p_j = 0$ involves the calculation $y_j \log p_j = 1 \log 0 = \inf$. Since we can't sum infinity meaningfully, the log loss function assigns a minimum and maximum probability that it sets predictions of 0.0 and 1.0 to, respectively.


## II. Analysis

### Data Exploration

The dataset is provided by Statoil, an international energy company, C-Core, who built the satellite computer vision system we are endeavoring to improve upon, with delivery provided by the good people at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

The two `json` files, named **`train.json`** and **`test.json`**, divide the data into training and testing sets respectively. They are identical except the latter does not have a `is_iceberg` column and is much larger than the former. 

For completeness, an entry in `train.json` and `test.json` contains the following fields:

* __`id`__ = ID of the image, for matching purposes
* __`band_1`, `band_2`__ = list of flattened image data in two bands. Each band is a 75x75 pixel image, so each list has 5625 elements. Values are decibels (dB) of radar backscatter at a given incidence angle and polarization. The polarization of `band_1` is HH, where the radar is transmitted and received in the horizontal plane. The polarization of `band_2` is HV, i.e. transmitted horizontally and received vertically. 
* __`inc_angle`__ = incidence angle of radar image. Some entries have missing data and are marked as `na`.
* __`is_iceberg`__ = target variable: 1 if iceberg, 0 if ship. Again, this field exists only in `train.json`

Note that there are XXX training examples and YYY testing examples. 

This means that (1) we must create our own validation set from the much smaller training set, and therefore (2) we must find ways to augment the training set with `keras` methods. 

#### Radar Data

This is a sample of `band_1` HH radar data. Note that it is somewhat normally distributed, but the bright spots of the area of interest (i.e. the iceberg or ocean-going vessel) makes it more heavily right-tailed. [Bentes et all (20XX)]() suggest a unique normalization method to bring those high values down into a somewhat more normal-looking distrubtion.

In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques

- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the modelâ€™s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your modelâ€™s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization

In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
